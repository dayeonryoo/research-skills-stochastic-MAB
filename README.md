To recreate the plots in the essay, please do the followings:

- Run stationary_algorithms.ipynb to recreate
    FIG 1. Fixed Exploration with N as a fraction of T
    FIG 3. Epsilon-Greedy with constant epsilon
    FIG 4. Epsilon-Greedy with decaying epsilon
    FIG 5. UCB with constant c
    FIG 6. Sensitivity analsysis of the 4 algorithms with respect to optimality gap

- Run fe_optimal_N.ipynb to recreate
    FIG 2. Fixed Exploration with optimal N as a function of log(T)
  (Note that fe_optimal_N.ipynb calls fixed_exploration.py)
